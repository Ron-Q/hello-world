# hello-world
my first steps on GitHub

I'm couriuos to find out what options GitHub can offer to improve my workflow.

up to now it is a bit worying

lets do some changes in the browser

now do changes in Rstudio

opened a new branch hwb01 in GitHub Desktop

do changes in Rstudio again

now I do some changes in the branch "hwb01". Where are they recorded?

It seems right in the folder of the project. But where is the master?  lets commit the changes an do some in the master branch.
